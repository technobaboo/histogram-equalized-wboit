# Histogram-Equalized WBOIT Demo

## Context

Comparing three transparency rendering techniques side-by-side in a wgpu demo. The demo
renders either a built-in quad/mesh scene or a **3D Gaussian Splatting** scene loaded from a
PLY file (see *3DGS Mode* below), through the same three techniques:
1. **Regular alpha blending** (baseline with ordering artifacts)
2. **Naive WBOIT** (McGuire & Bavoil 2013 - static depth-based weight function)
3. **Histogram-equalized WBOIT** (novel technique - uses a global depth histogram from the previous frame to build a CDF, which remaps depth values so WBOIT weights spread across the full f32 exponential range)

The goal is to show that adaptive weight redistribution via histogram equalization significantly improves WBOIT quality when fragments cluster at similar depths.

}
```

## Render Architecture

### Mode 1: Alpha Blend
> Pipeline: `src/pipeline/alpha_blend.rs` (single `RenderPipeline`)
> Shader: `shaders/alpha_blend.wgsl` (prepended with `shaders/common.wgsl`)
> Render path: `src/renderer.rs` `render_alpha_blend()`

Single pass:
- Color target: swapchain (clear to dark gray)
- Depth: depth texture (Depth32Float, clear)
- Blend: `SrcAlpha / OneMinusSrcAlpha` (standard)
- Draw all transparent objects unsorted

### Mode 2: Naive WBOIT
> Pipelines: `src/pipeline/naive_wboit.rs` (`accum_pipeline` + `composite_pipeline` + `composite_bgl`)
> Shaders: `shaders/wboit_accum.wgsl` (prepended with common), `shaders/wboit_composite.wgsl` (standalone)
> Render path: `src/renderer.rs` `render_naive_wboit()`

**Pass 1 - Accumulation (MRT):**
- Color 0: `Rgba16Float` accum texture (clear to 0,0,0,0)
  - Blend: `One + One` (additive)
- Color 1: `R8Unorm` revealage texture (clear to 1,0,0,0)
  - Blend: `Zero + OneMinusSrc` (multiplicative)
- Depth: depth texture (write disabled, depth test only)
- Fragment outputs: `(premul_color * w, alpha * w)` to color0, `alpha` to color1
- Weight function: `w = alpha * clamp(exp2(13.0 - 26.0 * d), 1e-4, 8192.0)`, where `d` is
  depth normalized over the geometry's depth window (see *Depth binning window*). This steps
  evenly through the f16 exponent range rather than using McGuire & Bavoil's original curve.

**Pass 2 - Composite (fullscreen triangle):**
- Color target: swapchain (clear to background)
- Blend: `SrcAlpha / OneMinusSrcAlpha`
- Sample accum and revealage textures
- Output: `color = accum.rgb / max(accum.a, 1e-5)`, `alpha = 1 - revealage`

### Mode 3: Histogram-Equalized WBOIT (global, 3 passes)
> Pipelines: `src/pipeline/histogram_wboit.rs` (`accum_pipeline` + `cdf_build_pipeline` (compute) + `composite_pipeline`)
> Shaders: `shaders/histo_accum.wgsl` (prepended with common), `shaders/histo_cdf_build.wgsl` (compute), `shaders/histo_composite.wgsl` (standalone)
> Render path: `src/renderer.rs` `render_histogram_wboit()`
> Buffer setup: `src/renderer.rs` `new()` (histogram_buffer, cdf_buffer, histo_params_buffer) and `resize()`

**Pass 1 - Accumulation + Optical Depth Histogram Recording:**
- Same MRT setup as Mode 2 (accum `Rgba16Float` + revealage `R8Unorm`)
- Additional bind groups: histogram buffer (`read_write`, atomic), CDF buffer (`read`), params uniform
- Fragment shader does:
  1. Compute linear depth `z` from clip-space (using `clip_position.w`)
  2. Compute bin index: `bin = clamp(u32(normalized_z * f32(num_bins)), 0, num_bins - 1)`
  3. Compute optical depth: `od = -ln(1 - alpha)`, quantize: `u32(od * OD_SCALE)` where `OD_SCALE = 4096`
  4. `atomicAdd(&histogram[bin], quantized_od)` - accumulates optical depth per bin (not fragment count)
  5. Read CDF from **previous frame** with piecewise-linear interpolation between `cdf[bin-1]` and `cdf[bin]`
  6. Reconstruct absolute cumulative optical depth: `tau = interpolated_cdf * cdf[num_bins]`
  7. Weight: `w = exp(-tau)` — exact transmittance before this layer (per-bin resolution)
  8. Output to MRT: `(premul_color * w, alpha * w)` to accum, `alpha` to revealage

**Pass 2 - CDF Build (compute shader):**
- Dispatch: `(1, 1, 1)` workgroups, `@workgroup_size(256, 1, 1)`
- Each thread handles one histogram bin
- Parallel inclusive prefix sum via Hillis-Steele (8 steps for 256 bins) using workgroup shared memory
- Normalize by total optical depth, write CDF. Store total OD in `cdf[num_bins]`. If total == 0, write linear fallback.
- Clear histogram to 0 via `atomicStore` for next frame.

**Pass 3 - Composite (fullscreen triangle):**
- Color target: swapchain (clear to background)
- Bind groups: accum texture, revealage texture, flag uniform
- Same composite math as Mode 2: read accum+revealage, output blended color

### Histogram Buffer Layout
> Created in `src/renderer.rs` `new()` and recreated in `resize()`

- Storage: `array<atomic<u32>>` of length `NUM_DEPTH_BINS` (256)
- `NUM_DEPTH_BINS = 256` (const in `src/renderer.rs:8`)
- Each bin accumulates **quantized optical depth** (`-ln(1-alpha) * OD_SCALE`), not fragment count

### CDF Buffer Layout
> Created in `src/renderer.rs` `new()`, initialized with linear fallback, recreated in `resize()`

- Storage: `array<f32>` of length `NUM_DEPTH_BINS + 1` (257)
- Entries 0-255: normalized cumulative optical depth; entry 256: total absolute optical depth
- `cdf[b]` = cumulative optical depth through bins 0..b, normalized to [0, 1]
- `cdf[num_bins]` = total absolute optical depth
- Written during compute pass (pass 2), read during accumulation pass (pass 1) of the *next* frame

## Key Technical Notes

- **Depth binning window (`camera.depth_min` / `camera.depth_range`)**: Both WBOIT modes
  normalize eye-space depth to `[0,1]` before using it, mode 2 for its weight curve and
  mode 3 for its histogram bins. That normalization uses the span the geometry actually
  occupies -- `[distance - scene_radius, distance + scene_radius]` -- **not** `near`/`far`.
  Using near/far is a trap: a camera fitted to a splat scene sets `near = 0.01r` and
  `far = 50r`, so the geometry (which sits at ~1.8r..3.2r) lands in 4% of the range. Every
  fragment then collapses into ~1.7 of the 64 histogram bins, mode 2's weight ratio falls
  from ~1e7x to 1.5x, and both modes degenerate into a flat average along the ray -- the
  washed-out look. With the fitted window the same scene spans ~38 bins. `Camera::uniform()`
  derives the window each frame; `scene_radius` defaults to 6.0 for the built-in quad scene
  and is set by `fit_to()` for loaded splats.
- **CDF is an EXCLUSIVE prefix sum, sampled with a half-texel shift**: `cdf[k]` holds the
  optical depth strictly in *front* of bin k, i.e. tau at the bin's near edge `z = k/N`. Two
  reasons. First, transmittance in front of a fragment must not include the fragment's own
  optical depth, nor that of anything else sharing its bin -- negligible for six quads, but
  dominant for a splat cloud with hundreds of fragments per bin. Second, with the exclusive
  form, linear filtering between texels interpolates between true bin *edges*, so a fragment
  a fraction `f` through bin k correctly picks up `f` of that bin's own optical depth.
  Because a 3D texture samples texel k at `(k+0.5)/N`, the accum shaders sample at
  `normalized_z + 0.5/num_bins` to line texel centres up with bin edges. Sampling an
  inclusive CDF at `normalized_z` (the earlier form) reads `tau(z + 0.5/N)` -- half a bin of
  over-occlusion on top of the self-occlusion.
- **Why the transmittance weight is exact**: `tau_total = -ln(R_prev)` and
  `CDF(z) = tau(z)/tau_total`, so `pow(R_prev, CDF(z)) = exp(-tau(z)) = T(z)`, the exact
  transmittance in front of the fragment. Since `sum(a_i * T_i)` telescopes to
  `1 - prod(1 - a_i)`, the composite `avg_color * (1 - revealage)` reduces algebraically to
  the exact front-to-back integral. Mode 3's error is therefore entirely in how well the
  binned, tiled, one-frame-late CDF approximates the true `tau(z)`.
- **Atomics in fragment shaders**: `atomicAdd` on `var<storage, read_write>` IS allowed in fragment shaders per WGSL spec. The underlying Vulkan feature `fragmentStoresAndAtomics` is widely supported on desktop.
- **CDF build via compute shader**: A single workgroup of 256 threads performs a parallel Hillis-Steele inclusive prefix sum, normalizes, writes CDF, and clears the histogram. Dispatched as `(1,1,1)` between the accum and composite render passes.
- **First frame**: CDF buffer initialized to linear fallback values `(1/256, 2/256, ..., 256/256)` with total optical depth = `257/256` on creation (`src/renderer.rs` `new()`). Histogram starts zeroed.
- **Temporal lag**: 1-frame delay is acceptable. CDF adapts smoothly as camera moves.
- **R8Unorm for revealage**: Well-tested, universally blendable. Multiplicative blend `(Zero, OneMinusSrc)` implements product of `(1 - alpha)`.
- **Rgba16Float for accum**: Supports blending without the `float32-blendable` feature.
- **Shader loading**: `format!("{}\n{}", common_wgsl, specific_wgsl)` concatenation since WGSL has no `#include`. Used in all three pipeline files via `include_str!`.
- **CDF buffer as non-atomic storage**: The CDF buffer is written by compute shader (pass 2) and read by fragment shader (pass 1 of next frame). Since these are in different passes of different frames, there's no synchronization issue. Use `var<storage, read_write>` with plain `f32` (not atomic).
- **wgpu 28 API**: `PipelineLayoutDescriptor` uses `immediate_size` (not `push_constant_ranges`), `RenderPipelineDescriptor` uses `multiview_mask: None` (not `multiview: None`), `RenderPassColorAttachment` requires `depth_slice: None`.

## 3DGS Mode
> Implemented in `src/ply.rs`, `src/splats.rs`, `src/pipeline/splat.rs`, `shaders/splat_*.wgsl`

```
cargo run --release -- splats/rem_v3_clear.ply
```

With a PLY argument the splat scene replaces the quad/mesh scene entirely; all three
transparency modes render it. Without an argument, nothing changes from the mesh demo.

### PLY parsing
> `src/ply.rs`

Two on-disk variants are handled, both `binary_little_endian`:

- **INRIA / original 3DGS**: `x,y,z`, `scale_0..2` (log space, exponentiated on load),
  `rot_0..3` (`w,x,y,z`, normalized), `opacity` (logit, sigmoid applied on load),
  `f_dc_0..2`, and optionally `f_rest_0..44` (channel-major: 15 coeffs of R, then G, then B).
- **PlayCanvas / SuperSplat compressed**: an `element chunk` of per-256-splat bounds plus
  four packed `u32` per vertex. Bit layouts match the PlayCanvas engine decoder:
  - `packed_position` / `packed_scale`: 11/10/11 unorm, lerped between the chunk's
    min/max bounds. Scale is still log space.
  - `packed_rotation`: 2-10-10-10 "largest three" — the top 2 bits name the omitted
    (largest) component, the rest are unorm mapped to `[-1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]`.
  - `packed_color`: 8888. RGB lerps between the chunk's colour bounds and is *already* the
    evaluated DC band (not a raw `f_dc` coefficient); A is *already* sigmoid-applied opacity.
  - An optional `element sh` carries quantized higher bands (`byte * 8/255 - 4`).

The loader reports a clear error on a truncated file rather than producing garbage.

### Coordinate frame
3DGS reconstructions come out of COLMAP with +Y down and +Z into the screen. Positions and
covariances are flipped by `diag(1, -1, -1)` at load time so the existing orbit camera's
+Y-up convention is correct. The shader undoes that flip on the view direction before
evaluating SH, whose coefficients live in the original frame.

### GPU layout
- `SplatGpu`, 64 bytes: `vec4(pos.xyz, opacity)`, `vec4(cov_xx, cov_xy, cov_xz, _)`,
  `vec4(cov_yy, cov_yz, cov_zz, _)`, `vec4(color.rgb, _)`. The 3D covariance is precomputed
  on the CPU as `M M^T` where `M = flip * R(quat) * diag(scale)`.
- SH buffer: `array<f32>`, 45 floats per splat, channel-major. A one-float dummy is bound
  when the file has no higher bands, so the bind group layout is the same either way.
- Order buffer: `array<u32>`, instance index -> splat index.

Splats are stored **sorted by importance** (`opacity * cbrt(sx*sy*sz)`) so the render cap
can simply draw a prefix and get the best subset of that size.

### Rendering
> `shaders/splat_common.wgsl`

One instanced 4-vertex triangle strip per splat. The vertex shader does EWA splatting
(Zwicker et al., as used by Kerbl et al. 2023):

1. Transform the centre to view space; cull anything at or behind the near plane.
2. Build the projection Jacobian `J` (with the sample point clamped to 1.3x the frustum
   extent, so the affine approximation stays sane off-screen) and the view rotation `W`.
3. `cov2d = J W cov3d W^T J^T`, plus a `+0.3` low-pass on the diagonal so every splat
   covers about a pixel.
4. Eigen-decompose the 2x2 result to get an oriented 3-sigma quad — far fewer wasted
   fragments than an axis-aligned bound on elongated splats.
5. Evaluate SH for the view direction and emit the conic (inverse `cov2d`).

The fragment shader evaluates `alpha = opacity * exp(-0.5 * d^T conic d)`, discards below
`1/255`, and hands the result to whichever mode's output is compiled in. All three splat
pipelines disable depth testing (`depth_write: false`, `compare: Always`) but still declare
a depth-stencil state, because they draw into the same render passes as the mesh path.

### Sorting (mode 1 only)
> `src/splats.rs`

Modes 2 and 3 are order-independent by construction and draw in whatever order the buffer
holds. Mode 1 needs a real back-to-front sort every frame, which is done as a **16-bit
counting sort on a background thread**: view-space depth is quantized to `u16`, so the sort
is a single O(n) counting pass with no comparisons. Measured at ~6 ms for 921k splats.

The render thread never blocks on it — it keeps drawing the previous frame's order until a
new one arrives, and only one request is ever in flight (the worker drops stale requests and
sorts the newest camera). At orbit speeds the one-frame lag is not visible.

## Scene
> Implemented in `src/scene.rs` (scene setup + auto-rotation) and `src/mesh.rs` (geometry generators)

- **6 overlapping semi-transparent quads** at various depths and angles, each a different color with alpha 0.35-0.55 (`src/scene.rs` `new()`)
- **Toggleable meshes**: A transparent cube (`mesh::cube`) and UV-sphere (`mesh::uv_sphere`), slowly auto-rotating (`src/scene.rs` `update()`)
- **Camera**: Orbit camera using spherical coordinates (`src/camera.rs`)
  - `glam::Mat4::perspective_rh()` for projection
  - `glam::Mat4::look_at_rh()` for view
  - Spherical coords: `eye = target + distance * vec3(cos(pitch)*sin(yaw), sin(pitch), cos(pitch)*cos(yaw))`
- **Background**: Dark gray (0.1, 0.1, 0.1) clear color (set in each render pass in `src/renderer.rs`)
